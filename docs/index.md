### Insights

Graphs, charts, and quick insights let you quickly overview an entire app. Check what you've done recently, what's upcoming, and trends about your workflow. Take a look at your progress into long-term goals and how close you are to your valuable rewards.

#### Things to consider

- Should it be a central place of the app (or the planner)
- How to make insights insightful
- How to highlight trends in an intelligent manner

### Planner

View your goals, tasks, and notes (by creation and assigned date) in calendar view and easily track everything day by day. It makes long and short-term tasks effortlessly manageable at the same time. Moreover, it lets you efficiently add these things to future dates.

#### Critical things to keep in mind

- Ability to recognize each thing type at the first glance
- Let users manage a day/week/month with the same level of simplicity

### Goals

Long-term activities can consist of many tasks. Users should be encouraged to split them into as many chunks as possible for simple estimation. Check how close you're to crossing your finish line and what's left to do.

#### Vital points

- Keep user up to date with his progression
- Warn user when doing poorly
- Don't overwhelm the user with all left tasks
- Should part of the goals be tasks or some separate entity

### Tasks

Short-term duties that you can manage every minute. Plan how much time you want to spend on something or mark them as indeterminate. Check what's on your plate today, kind of detailed todos list.

#### Considerations

- Display in a transparent way both daily and longer tasks
- Let the user track the time and simplify the process but don't overforce it
- Possibility of it being Pomodoro dashboard ilk

### Notes

Sort of self-explanatory feature. The distinguishable feature is the possibility to connect with other items. There should also be an option to assign a note to some date in the future, reminder-style.

#### Thoughts

- The key is to make them easily manageable. Notes tend to turn into a mess
- How exactly the connection with other things should work

### Rewards

After you acquire story points, the app lets you use them as points available to spend for rewards. Each user will have to add custom rewards - there won't be any predefined ones. Track your progress towards valuable things and keep your motivation rock solid.

#### To keep in mind

- Maybe notify a user when a reward is available to buy
- The whole gamification pillar stands on this feature

## Other ideas

The possibility of linking various things together via a system similar to tags could be helpful. However, it could be overwhelming. Things are somehow linked together already. But what if you want to group a few notes? Maybe this feature should be more like categories than tags?

The ability to quickly search across everything in the app sounds practical. A full-text search is possible. Is fuzzy search also implementable within the tech stack?
